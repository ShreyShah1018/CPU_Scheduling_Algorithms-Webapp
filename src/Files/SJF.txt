Shortest Job First
Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.

Here are the benefits/pros of using SJF method:
1. It reduces the average waiting time over FIFO (First in First Out) algorithm.
2. SJF method gives the lowest average waiting time for a specific set of processes.
3. For the batch system of long-term scheduling, a burst time estimate can be obtained from the job description.
4. For Short-Term Scheduling, we need to predict the value of the next burst time.
5. Probably optimal with regard to average turn-around time.

Here are some drawbacks/cons of SJF algorithm:
1. Job completion time must be known earlier, but it is hard to predict.
2. SJF can’t be implemented for CPU scheduling for the short term.
3. This algorithm may cause very long turn-around times or starvation.
4. Requires knowledge of how long a process or job will run.
5. It is hard to know the length of the upcoming CPU request.
6. Elapsed time should be recorded, that results in more overhead on the processor.
