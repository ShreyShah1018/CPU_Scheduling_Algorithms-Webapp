Round Robin
In Round-robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limited time slice, this limited time slice is also called time quanta. This algorithm also offers starvation free execution of processes.

Here, are pros/benefits of Round-robin scheduling method:
1. It doesn’t face the issues of starvation or convoy effect.
2. It gives the best performance in terms of average response time.
3. It deals with all process without any priority
4. If you know the total number of processes on the run queue, then you can also assume the worst-case response time for the same process.
5. This scheduling method does not depend upon burst time. That’s why it is easily implementable on the system.
6. Allows OS to use the Context switching method to save states of preempted processes.

Here, are drawbacks/cons of using Round-robin scheduling:
1. This method spends more time on context switching
2. Its performance heavily depends on time quantum.
3. Priorities cannot be set for the processes.
4. Round-robin scheduling doesn’t give special priority to more important tasks.
5. Lower time quantum results in higher the context switching overhead in the system.
6. Finding a correct time quantum is a quite difficult task in this system.
