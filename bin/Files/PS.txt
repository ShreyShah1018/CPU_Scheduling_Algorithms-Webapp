Priority Scheduling
Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority.

The processes with higher priority should be carried out first, whereas jobs with equal priorities are carried out on a round-robin or FCFS basis. Priority depends upon memory requirements, time requirements, etc.

Here, are benefits/pros of using priority scheduling method:
1. Easy to use scheduling method
2. Processes are executed on the basis of priority so high priority does not need to wait for long which saves time
3. This method provides a good mechanism where the relative important of each process may be precisely defined.
4. Suitable for applications with fluctuating time and resource requirements.

Here, are cons/drawbacks of priority scheduling
1. If the system eventually crashes, all low priority processes get lost.
2. This scheduling algorithm may leave some low priority processes waiting indefinitely.
3. A process will be blocked when it is ready to run but has to wait for the CPU because some other process is running currently.
4. If a new higher priority process keeps on coming in the ready queue, then the process which is in the waiting state may need to wait for a long duration of time.
